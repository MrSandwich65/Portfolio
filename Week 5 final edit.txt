           <h2>About Home Brewing Beer</h2>
           <p>Homebrewing is a growing hobby for anyone interested in craft beer or learning the art.
              There are multiple styles of beer homebrewers will attempt to craft. Below, we will
              discuss the various, basic methods for crafting your own brew!</p>
       </section>

       <section id="introduction">
           <h2>Introduction</h2>
           <ul>
               <li><p><u>Styles</u></p>
                   There are many different styles in the craft beer hobby. Some of these styles include
                   IPA's, Stouts, Lagers, Pilsners, Porters, Lambic's, and a variety of variants
                   of these styles. Creating these styles requires 4 basic ingredients; Water, Grain,
                   Hops, and Yeast.

		  <p><u>Hardware and Tools</u></p>
		  Certain hardware and tools are required for homebrewers to get their home operation underway.
		  It is recommended that all first time brewers pick up a homebrewing starter kit.
		  Check out the link below for starter kits with all the essentials!

           <h2>Ingredients and Essentials</h2>
               <p>Ingredients:</p>
           <ul>
               <li><p><u>Ingredients and Essentials</u></p>
		Water is one of the 4 most essential ingredients to the brewing process. Many different
		kinds of water can be used. Spring water, Distilled water, or water directly from the tap!
		Different styles of beer may require ph testing to be done to make sure the chemicals in the
		water aren't going to affect the outcome of the beer at the end of the fermentation process.<br>

		Grain or extract (depending on the style of brewing being done, will be another of the 4 main
		ingreidents in making a delicious home brew. The grain will not only help set up the color
		and flavor of your beer, but it will also determine the ABV (alchol ny volume) in your beer.
		The amount of sugars in the grain or extract will convert to alcohol during the fermentation
		process after the hops and yeast have been added.<br>

		Which leads me to hops, the third of the 4 main ingredients in brewing. Hops play an incredibly
		important role in what kind of flavors or styles of beer you're wanting to produce.There are a
		wide variety of hops. Some hops are used for bittering, some are used for aroma, and others are
		used for their dual purpose qualities. Some bittering hops include Columbus, Comet, Summit, Magnum,
		and Nugget to name a few. The aromatic hops include Citra, Mosaic, Centennial, Galaxy, and Montueka.
		In some cases, the same hops you have used for bittering can also be used for aromatics. How this
		is determind will be solely up to the brewer's preferences based on the style of beer they are brewing.</li>

		<!--Insert paragraph text-->
		<p>Once all of the essential brewing ingredients are acquired, your brew day will be ready to<br>
		begin. Below are all the steps required to begin your first successful brew day!</p>
		
 		<h4><u>Step One:</u></h4>
		<!--Insert paragraph text-->
		<p>Prepare water for boil.</p>
		<p>Gather homebrew starter kist and a heating device like a campfire stove or floor standing burner<br>
		from your local homebrew shop or an online distributor. In the kettle that you picked up with your <br>
		starter kit, pour in 5-7 gallons of water and bring to a rolling boil. (Volume of water will be determined<br>
		by your batch size and how much you will lose due to evaporation.</p>

		<!--Insert Heading-->
		<h4><u>Step Two:</u></h4>
		<!--Insert paragraph text-->
		<p>Add Grain/Extract to Boil.</p>
		<p>In this step, you will add the grain that you ordered for your brew. If ordering grains from an online<br>
		distributor, make sure the grains are milled or you have a grain mill available (milling the grain allows<br>
		the sugars to be rinsed from the inner shell of the grain. The sugar is later converted to alcohol)<br>
		There are different options when adding grain. The brew-in-a-bag method (BIAB) has become the most common and <br>
		easy way for homebrewers to achieve excellent results with minimal hiccups and shorter clean up times.<br>
		You will first start with heating your water to 145-170 degrees to steep your grain for 45 minutes to 1 hour. This<br>
		process will allow the maximum amount of sugars to be rinsed from the grain. The final product is called "wort"</p>

		<h4><u>Step Three:</u></h4>
		<!--Insert paragraph text-->
		<p>Addition of Hops.</p>
		<p>In this step, you will add the hops. Hops are the main ingredient that will determine the flavor of your final <br>
		product. If hops are added durin the boil, the outcome will be a more bitter brew. If the hops are added <br>
		late in the boil, during the whirlpool, prior to pitching yeast, or dry-hopping, the brew will be less <br>
		bitter and the flavors of the hops will shine. This is typically done in the IPA style to showcase the <br>
		different hop flavors and characteristics. For a less hoppy beer, a small amount of hops will be added to <br>
		the boil. For a more hoppy, flavorful brew, more hops and more hop varieties will be added. Again, it is all <br>
		up to the brewer and the style of beer they are trying to achieve.</p>

		<h4><u>Step Four:</u></h4>
		<!--Insert paragraph text-->
		<p>Pitching Yeast.</p>
		<p>In this final step, you will be adding the yeast, also known as "pitching". Once the wort cools, you've added all <br>
		your hops, and have sanitized all your equipment, you will pitch the yeast. From the boil kettle, transfer all the wort <br>
		to your sanitized fermenter. Sanitize the outside of your yeast packet, cut it open with sanitized scissors, <br>
		and pour the powder or liquid yeast directly into the fermenter. Seal up the fermenter and shake it vigorously <br>
		for a minute to oxygenate the beer and activate the yeast. A fermentation time of 7-14 days will be required <br>
		depending on the beer you are brewing. You'll know it's finished when you no longer see fermentation activity <br>
		in the blow-off.</p>
